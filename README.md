# hello-world
First repository ever!

Hi humans,

I am Deaf and father of three year old boy who has a fiery passion for ensuring that my son has future. As everyone knows, the next-generation children might not have future. It needs to mitigate using carbon capture and storage and negative emission technologies. I hope that I can make this Git useful for making some difference, like econometrics and statistics. I look forward to getting involved in this data science world.

Best,

Deafjonah
